# 🎁 Pop Now Navigator - Your Friendly Labubu Detective

Ever felt like playing "Where's Waldo?" but with adorable Labubu boxes? Well, this extension is your magnifying glass! 🔍

## What's This All About?

Pop Now Navigator is your trusty sidekick for keeping track of which Labubu boxes you've already checked. Think of it as your digital notebook, but way cooler and with emojis! Also useful during a fresh restock drop, quickly navigate among the hundreds of new box sets and grab one before it sells out!

## Features

### 📦 Grid Navigation
- A fun visual way to see box sets, grouped by a 10x10 grid that represents 100 box sets at a time
- Click anywhere in the grid to take you directly to that box id
- Boxes are color-coded:
  - 🔵 Current box you're viewing
  - ❓ Future box sets not yet released (restock needed)
  - ⬜ Unexplored territory
  - 🟢 Available boxes with their quantity

### 🎲 Random Jump
- Feeling lucky? Hit the dice button!
- Randomly jumps 1-30 boxes ahead
- Perfect for when you can't decide where to look next

### 🎁 Next Restock Tracker
- Remembers that last box id you found that isn't available yet but will be part of a future restock
- Feature: Can also check online to get the next restock box for the three most popular labubu.  Note this is updated once per 24 hours, and won't have the latest restock box during a live restocking event, only the next restock number from the previous day.
- Helps you skip already checked sections directly to the next set of boxes to be restocked
- No more clicking through sold-out boxes!
