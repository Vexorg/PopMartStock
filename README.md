# 🎁 Pop Now Navigator - Your Friendly Labubu Detective

Ever felt like playing "Where's Waldo?" but with adorable Labubu boxes? Well, this extension is your magnifying glass! 🔍

## What's This All About?

Pop Now Navigator is your trusty sidekick for finding available boxes and keeping track of which Labubu boxes you've already checked. Think of it as your digital notebook, but way cooler! This tool is invaluable during a fresh restock drop, allowing you to quickly navigate among the hundreds of new box sets and grab one before it sells out!

## Features

### 📦 Grid Navigation
- A fun visual way to see box sets, grouped by a 10x10 grid that represents 100 box sets at a time
- Click anywhere in the grid to take you directly to that box id
- Boxes are color-coded:
  - 🔵 Current box you're viewing
  - ❓ Future box sets not yet released (restock needed)
  - ⬜ Unexplored territory
  - 🟢 Available boxes with their quantity

### 🎲 Random Jump
- Feeling lucky? Hit the dice button to randomly jumps 1-30 boxes ahead
- Perfect for when you can't decide where to look next

### 🎁 Next Restock Tracker
- This remembers that last box id you found that isn't available yet but will be part of a future restock
- Feature: Can also check online to get the next restock box for the three most popular labubu.  Note this is updated once per 24 hours, and won't have the latest restock box during a live restocking event, only the next restock number from the previous day.
- Helps you skip already checked boxes, no more clicking through sold-out boxes!

## How to Use

1. Install the extension
2. Visit Pop Mart's Pop Now section and click on any character you want to buy.

4. Click boxes to check availability
5. The extension remembers everything for your next visit


## Restock Info:**  
Pop Now restocks for Macaron and HAS typically begin daily at 5:30pm PST, with 2–4 batches released every 10 minutes. BIE restocks are less frequent, usually occurring on Wednesdays and/or Thursdays between 5:30pm and 6:30pm PST.

Best advice is to switch to the grid that contains the box set that will restock next (using the restock button to jump to) and randomly pick one one of those red cells from the navigation tool randomly.  A restock range is usually 100-200 box sets, so pick something within that range, and refresh the page a few times starting at 5:29pm PST and hope you picked a bot set that you're able to add to cart fast enough.

For the best chance at snagging a box during a restock, switch to the grid containing the next restock box set (use the restock button to jump there), then randomly select one of the highlighted red cells in the navigation tool. Restock ranges typically cover 100–200 box sets, so choose a box within that range. Start refreshing that red cell beginning at 5:29pm PST, and be ready to add your chosen box to the cart as soon as it becomes available at 5:30pm PST.  If you miss out, quickly pick another cell that has a higher box set id to try again. If you still don’t succeed after a few different cells, wait until 5:40pm PST for the next restock batch and repeat the process.

## Important Note

This is just a helper tool for navigating boxes more efficiency and remembering which boxes you've already checked - no magic, no tricks, just good old-fashioned box tracking! You still must do everything manually, there are no features to auto add things to your cart. We love Pop Mart and want to keep things fair and fun! 💖
