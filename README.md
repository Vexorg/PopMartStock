# 🎁 Pop Now Navigator - Your Friendly Labubu Detective

Ever felt like playing "Where's Waldo?" but with adorable Labubu boxes? Well, this extension is your magnifying glass! 🔍

## What's This All About?

Pop Now Navigator is your trusty sidekick for finding available boxes and keeping track of which Labubu boxes you've already checked. Think of it as your digital notebook, but way cooler! This tool is invaluable during a fresh restock drop, allowing you to quickly navigate among the hundreds of new box sets and grab one before it sells out!

## Features

### 📦 Grid Navigation
- A fun visual way to see box sets, grouped by a 10x10 grid that represents 100 box sets at a time
- Click anywhere in the grid to take you directly to that box id
- Boxes are color-coded:
  - 🔵 Current box you're viewing
  - 🔒 Box sets part of the next restock (not yet available)
  - ⬜ Unexplored territory
  - 🟢 Available boxes with their quantity

### 🎲 Random Jump
- Feeling lucky? Hit the dice button to randomly jumps 1-40 boxes ahead
- Perfect for when you can't decide where to look next

### 🎯 Next Restock Tracker
- Helps you skip already checked boxes, no more clicking through sold-out boxes!
- The navigator automatically remembers any unavailable box sets you’ve discovered that are expected to restock in the future.
It also fetches the next expected restock box set for the three most popular Labubu characters using online data.
*Note: This online data updates every 12 hours and may not reflect the latest box numbers during live restock events — it shows the next predicted restock from the previous day.*

2. Visit Pop Mart's Pop Now section and click on any character you want to buy.
3. Look at the left side of your screen - that's your new command center!

## Restock Info:**  
Pop Now restocks for Macaron and HAS typically begin daily at 5:30pm PST. BIE restocks are less frequent, usually occurring on Wednesdays and/or Thursdays between 5:30pm and 6:30pm PST.

For the best chance at snagging a box during a restock, switch to the grid containing the next restock box set (use the restock button to jump there), then randomly select one of the highlighted red cells in the navigation tool. Restock ranges typically cover 300–500 box sets, so choose a box within that range. Start refreshing that red cell beginning at 5:29pm PST, and be ready to add your chosen box to the cart as soon as it becomes available.  If you miss out, quickly pick another cell that has a higher box set id to try again.

## Important Note

This is just a helper tool for navigating boxes more efficiency and remembering which boxes you've already checked - no magic, no tricks, just good old-fashioned box tracking! You still must do everything manually. We love Pop Mart and want to keep things fair and fun! 💖
